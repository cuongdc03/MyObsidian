Promises are a much better way to work with asynchronous code in JavaScript than the old and error-prone callback approach. They were introduced into JavaScript with ECMAScript 6. Using promises, we can manage extremely complex asynchronous code with rigorous error-handling setup, write code in a more or less synchronous style, and keep ourselves from running into the so-called callback hell.
## Example Syntax
```js

new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
   setTimeout(function() {
      resolve('Hello');
   }, 3000);
})
.then(function(value) {
   console.log(value);
});
//After 3s consolelog run 
```
