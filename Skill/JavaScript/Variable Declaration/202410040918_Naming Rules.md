1, Be descriptive
```
For instance, suppose that you have to store a user's name in a variable. It would be really bad if you name the variable `a` (or `x` or `u` for _'user'_, or any random character). The name `a` doesn't tell much about what's stored in the variable.

A much better name would be `username`, or `uname`.
```
2,Don't be overly descriptive
```
Suppose we want to create a variable that stores the first name of a user. Being exceptionally descriptive, we could name it `thefirstnameofuser`, although this would be more than the required amount of description.

A better name would be `firstname`.
```
3,Abbreviate long words
```
Sometimes, it's really helpful to abbreviate long words in a given name to short and simple words, given that the abbreviation seems sensible.

For example, the variable `dbname` could work well instead of `databasename`. Here, we've abbreviated _'database'_ to _'db'_.
```
4,Use a casing convention to break words
When a variable's name contains more than one word, it's desirable to use some **casing convention** to be able to distinguish between them easily while reading the variable.
