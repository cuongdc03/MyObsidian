An **IIFE** (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript) [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Function) that runs as soon as it is defined. The name IIFE is promoted by Ben Alman in [his blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033208/http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/#iife).
# Use Case
# Avoid polluting the global namespace 
Because our application could include many functions and global variables from different source files, it's important to limit the number of global variables. If we have some initiation code that we don't need to use again, we could use the IIFE pattern. As we will not reuse the code again, using IIFE in this case is better than using a function declaration or a function expression.
```js
(() => {
  // some initiation code
  let firstVariable;
  let secondVariable;
})();

// firstVariable and secondVariable will be discarded after the function is executed.

```
# Execute an async function
An [`async`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/async_function) IIFE allows you to use [`await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) and [`for-await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) even in older browsers and JavaScript runtimes that have no [top-level await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await#top_level_await):
```js
const getFileStream = async (url) => {
  // implementation
};

(async () => {
  const stream = await getFileStream("https://domain.name/path/file.ext");
  for await (const chunk of stream) {
    console.log({ chunk });
  }
})();

```
