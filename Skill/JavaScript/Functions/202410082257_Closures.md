A **closure** in JavaScript is a feature where an inner function has access to variables from its outer (enclosing) function, even after the outer function has returned. Closures allow the function to retain access to the scope it was created in.

A closure gives access to:

1. Variables from its own scope.
2. Variables from the outer function's scope.
3. Global variables.
