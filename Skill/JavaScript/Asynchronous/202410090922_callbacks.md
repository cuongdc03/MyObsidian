# Introduction
Many functions are provided by JavaScript host environments that allow you to schedule _asynchronous_ actions. In other words, actions that we initiate now, but they finish later.

For instance, one such function is the `setTimeout` function.
# Callback in call back
How can we load two scripts sequentially: the first one, and then the second one after it?

The natural solution would be to put the second `loadScript` call inside the callback, like this:

# Handling errors
In the above examples we didn’t consider errors. What if the script loading fails? Our callback should be able to react on that.

Because of this reason ==> [[202410090932_Promise]],[[202410090939_Async - await]]
