There’s a special syntax to work with promises in a more comfortable fashion, called “async/await”. It’s surprisingly easy to understand and use.
# Async functions
The word “async” before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically.
## Example 
```javascript
async function f(){
	return 1;
}
```

# Await 
## syntax 
```javascript
let value = await promise;
```
The keyword `await` makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.
Here’s an example with a promise that resolves in 1 second:
