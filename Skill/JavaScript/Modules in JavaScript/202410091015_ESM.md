A module may contain a class or a library of functions for a specific purpose.

For a long time, JavaScript existed without a language-level module syntax. That wasn’t a problem, because initially scripts were small and simple, so there was no need.

But eventually scripts became more and more complex, so the community invented a variety of ways to organize code into modules, special libraries to load modules on demand.
To name some (for historical reasons):
- [AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition) – one of the most ancient module systems, initially implemented by the library [require.js](https://requirejs.org/).
- [CommonJS](https://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1) – the module system created for Node.js server.
- [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) – one more module system, suggested as a universal one, compatible with AMD and CommonJS.
## What is a module?
A module is just a file. One script is one module. As simple as that.
Modules can load each other and use special directives `export` and `import` to interchange functionality, call functions of one module from another one:

- `export` keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module.
- `import` allows the import of functionality from other modules.
## Example 
We have a module sayHi:
```javascript
// sayHi.js
export function sayHi(user){
alert('Hello, ${user}!');
}
```
…Then another file may import and use it:
```javascript
//main.js
import {sayHi} from './sayHi.js'
alert(sayhi);
sayHi('John');
```
# Summary
To summarize, the core concepts are:

1. A module is a file. To make `import/export` work, browsers need `<script type="module">`. Modules have several differences:
    - Deferred by default.
    - Async works on inline scripts.
    - To load external scripts from another origin (domain/protocol/port), CORS headers are needed.
    - Duplicate external scripts are ignored.
2. Modules have their own, local top-level scope and interchange functionality via `import/export`.
3. Modules always `use strict`.
4. Module code is executed only once. Exports are created once and shared between importers.

When we use modules, each module implements the functionality and exports it. Then we use `import` to directly import it where it’s needed. The browser loads and evaluates the scripts automatically.

In production, people often use bundlers such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle modules together for performance and other reasons.
