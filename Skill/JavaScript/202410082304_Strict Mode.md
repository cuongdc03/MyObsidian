# "use strict"
The directive looks like a string: `"use strict"` or `'use strict'`. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way. Example:
```
"use strict"
// this code work the modern way
```
Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics:

- Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
- Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes run faster than identical code that’s not strict mode.
- Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.
