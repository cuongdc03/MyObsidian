## Structure 
![[Pasted image 20241024093039.png]]
## Solution 
- Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the `new` operator with the Singleton class.
- Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.
## Problem 
The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the _Single Responsibility Principle_:

- **Ensure that a class has just a single instance**.
- **Provide a global access point to that instance**.
## Example 
```ts
class Singleton {
    static #instance: Singleton;

    /**
     * The Singleton's constructor should always be private to prevent direct
     * construction calls with the `new` operator.
     */
    private constructor() { }

    /**
     * The static getter that controls access to the singleton instance.
     *
     * This implementation allows you to extend the Singleton class while
     * keeping just one instance of each subclass around.
     */
    public static get instance(): Singleton {
        if (!Singleton.#instance) {
            Singleton.#instance = new Singleton();
        }

        return Singleton.#instance;
    }

    /**
     * Finally, any singleton can define some business logic, which can be
     * executed on its instance.
     */
    public someBusinessLogic() {
        // ...
    }
}
```
