TS has special syntax for functions that return a boolean meant to indicate whether an argument is a particular type.this is referred to as a type predicate, also sometimes called a "user-defined type guard"
Type predicateâ€™s return types can be declared as the name of a parameter, the is
keyword, and some type:
```ts
function typePredicate(input: WideType): input is NarrowType;
```
