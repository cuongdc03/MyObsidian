| 202410111415_Unknown | [[TypeScript]] | [[learning_typescript.pdf#page=152]] |
unkown is similar to [[202410111405_any,Again||any]] in that all object may be passed to locations of type unknown. The key difference with unknown is that [[TypeScript]] is much more restrictive about the value of type unknown:
- [[TypeScript]] doesn't allow directly accessing properties of unknown typed values.
- unknown is not assignable to types that are not a top type ([[202410111405_any,Again|any]]or [[202410111415_Unknown|unknown]])
```ts
function greetComedian(name: unknown) {
console.log(`Announcing ${name.toUpperCase()}!`);
~~~~
// Error: Object is of type 'unknown'.
}
```

The only way TypeScript will allow code to access members on a name of type unknown is if the valueâ€™s type is narrowed, such as using instanceof or typeof, or with a type assertion.
