If you have a one/many commits in you can push these commits to Remote Repo
```
$ git push origin <branch_name>
```

if you wanna set--upstream after set--upstream you have not to set origin to branch
```
$ git push -u origin <branch_name>
```

if you can't push normally, you must find to [[git push force]] or [[git push force-with-lease]]
