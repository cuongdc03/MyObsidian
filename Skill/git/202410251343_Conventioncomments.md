## Format
Adhering to a consistent format improves reader's expectations and machine readability. Here's the format we propose:
```ls
<label> [decorations]: <subject>

[discussion]
```
- _label_ - This is a single label that signifies what kind of comment is being left.
- _subject_ - This is the main message of the comment.
- _decorations (optional)_ - These are extra decorating labels for the comment. They are surrounded by parentheses and comma-separated.
- _discussion (optional)_ - This contains supporting statements, context, reasoning, and anything else to help communicate the “why” and “next steps” for resolving the comment.
