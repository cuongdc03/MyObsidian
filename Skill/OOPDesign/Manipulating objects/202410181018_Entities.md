`Identifiable objects that track changes and record events`
An entity may change over time, but it should always be the same object that under-goes the changes. That’s why an entity needs to be identifiable. When creating it, we give it an identifier

This identifier can be used by the entity’s repository to save the object. Later on, we can use that same identifier to retrieve it from the repository, after which it can be modified again.

Given that the state of an entity changes over time, entities are mutable objects. They
come with specific rules for their implementation:
-  The methods that change the entity’s state should have a void return type and their names should be in the imperative form (e.g., addLine(), finalize()).
 - These methods have to protect the entity against ending up in an invalid state(e.g., addLine() checks that the invoice hasn’t been finalized already).
 - The entity shouldn’t expose all its internals to test what’s going on inside.Instead, an entity should keep a change log and expose that, so other objects can find out what has changed about it, and why.
