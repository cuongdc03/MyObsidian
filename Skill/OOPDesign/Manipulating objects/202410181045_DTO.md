`Simple objects with fewer design rules`
Although some people prefer to implement DTOs as immutable objects, this level of protection often gets in the way of other characteristics you may be after. For instance, you may want to fill the properties one by one, based on data submitted by the user. You also won’t want to maintain or unit test a DTO, as it has no significant behavior (it just holds data), so you won’t want it to have too many methods (such as getters and setters). In the end, you may settle on using public properties.
```php
final class CreateSalesInvoice
{
/**
* @final
*/
public string date;
/**
* @var Line[]
* @final
*/
public array lines = [];
}
final class Line
{
/**
* @final
*/
public int productId;
/**
* @final
*/
public int quantity;
}
```
We don’t have design rules for data transfer objects that are as strong as the rules for entities and value objects. For the latter, design quality and data integrity are more important than they are for data transfer objects. This is why the design rules in this
chapter apply to entities and value objects.
