A service usually needs other services to do its job. Those other services are its dependencies, and they should be injected as constructor arguments. The following File-Logger class is an example of a service with its dependency.

Making every dependency available as a constructor argument will make the service
ready for use immediately after instantiation. No further setup will be required, and
you canâ€™t accidentally forget to provide a dependency.
