When a method returns a piece of information, it should return a predictable thing.
No mixed types are allowed. Most languages donâ€™t even support mixed types, but PHP,being a dynamically typed language does. Take, for example, the following isValid() method, which omits a return type, allowing several types of things to be returned.This will be very confusing for its users.![[Pasted image 20241018143316.png]]
