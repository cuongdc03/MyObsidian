Finally, a method may return something. In fact, only query methods should do that.We’ll discuss this topic in detail in the next chapter.
Another good rule to keep in mind is to return early. We’ve encountered this rule for exceptions already: as soon as you know something is going wrong, throw an exception about it. The same applies to return values. As soon as you know what you
will return, return it right away instead of keeping the value around, skipping a few more if clauses, and then returning it.
