Yesterday:
- SWMS Chat API: Using async/await to change v2 but there is no change becauce this API just have 1 Thread processing `Generate_without_rag` so that apply async/await there is no change in this case (sometime v2 run slower than v1)
---> Solve way: try to modify Prompt Template make it shorter
